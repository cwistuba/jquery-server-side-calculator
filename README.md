# JQuery Server Side Calculator Master

## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

I created a user interface where the user can input two values (2 input elements) and the select type of mathematical operation. When the submit (`=` button) is clicked, the interface will capture this input, bundle it up in an object, and send this object to the server via a POST. The 'C' button clears the user input fields.

The server handles Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. Once the calculation is complete, I have a GET request after the POST to get the actual calculation.
